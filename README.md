# Stage-Timer
A custom stage timer made for TEDx FISAT. Uses 2.3" Seven segment displays to indicate time.

A PCB was designed only for the seven segment displays consisting of ULN2003 as the digit driver and BD140 transistor as digit drivers.
The display was driven with an Arduino Pro Mini.

The timer was programmed in Arduino and the following libraries were used.
* [Countimer] (https://github.com/inflop/Countimer) by inflop
* [SevenSeg] (https://github.com/sigvaldm/SevenSeg) by sigvaldm

Illustrator design is included for a Laser-Cut case for the timer in 3mm acrylic.
